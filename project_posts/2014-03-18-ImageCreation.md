Image creation

Part of the challenge of the project is the representation of audio as an image. It needs to be simple, so the user can modify it easily from a mobile device, abstract, and beatiful, so the user is attracted to the image and gets interested not only on the sonic aspect but also on the visual one.

We looked at others visual representations of data, going from fractals, celular automatas, network diagrams etc, here are some images we found inspiring for the project:
