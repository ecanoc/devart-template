all interior surfaces are painted glossy black including floor and ceiling
entrance and exit opening are covered by a heavy felt black curtain
surround sound inside the box

03 & 04
Tablet size screens are located on all sides of the box, at eye height, forming a 'sound wave' pattern
images and sounds are played randomly in the screens creating a symphony as well as a moving image that is constantly changing as they get uploaded by the users

HOW:
users play with the app, and upload their projects. 
each project consits of the following: 
		initial sound
		initial image
		new sound
		new image
	all four components get uploaded

projects from different users get played in a random sequence, a screen gets randomly chosen, where the four components, get played, in a constant loop. 
The sound plays for the 10 sec duration, first the original, then the modified one, one porject after the other. The image howver, stays in the screen, until all the screens are in use, and then, the new project replaces the image too. 
This generates a constantly changing both sound and visual landscape created by the users.
