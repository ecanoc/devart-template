# Visual Sound
      
    Estefanía Cano & Julia A Cano


*VISUAL SOUND* comes from a combination of shared and individual interests of the authors. Estefanía is a musician and engineer working with audio technology, and Julia is an architect and designer working with code as a design and aesthetic tool. 
The projects consists of an  App that allows the user to 'paint sound'.  To be able to 'paint sound', an audio input gets transformed into a graphic representation which in turn gets transformed by the user via 'painting'. The trasnformed graphic representation then feeds back into the audio piece effectively modifying it. 

There are two very exciting components about the project -how to represent audio graphically, and vice versa, how does the modified image gets translated back into sound.
